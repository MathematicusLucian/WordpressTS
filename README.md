# WordpressTS

The goal behind this project is to remove the front-end from the back-end WordPress installation. By utilizing WP-API and other plugins you can turn your WordPress installation into a back-end API endpoint.
  
By decoupling front-and back-ends this project aims to:  
- Make theme development easier--no PHP!  
- Enable back-end-as-a-service for WordPress (i.e. WordPress is installed on a different server than your front-end files)  
- Speedier blogs and websites (e.g. CDN for your front-end and caching of API requests)  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.
